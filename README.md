# Todo-MVI-Koin

This is a simple Todo application that makes use of the following in a proper way:

1. Todo App is written in MVI architecture (Model View Intent).
2. This App uses Navigation architecture components for fragments.
3. Koin is used for Data injection.
4. Room Database to store local data which is the single source of truth throughtout the app.
5. Code is more maintainable and easy to edit as it follows repository pattern.

Todo: Trying to split each package (database, create, listing) to separate module's for code maintainability.
